        I am an experienced Full Stack Developer proficient in building scalable
        applications using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js),
        along with Next.js, Nest.js, and Spring Boot. My expertise also includes
        C++, Python, and Java, giving me a strong foundation in both web and
        software development. I have extensive experience in backend services,
        database management, and CI/CD pipelines, and I am skilled in deploying
        applications on AWS. Additionally, I work with microservices and Kafka
        for efficient communication. Passionate about Agile methodologies, I
        utilize tools like Bitbucket and Jira to deliver robust solutions while
        continuously learning and improving my skillset.
